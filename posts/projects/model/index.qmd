• Key project features include: quantification of sex ratio functions, simulation of parasite diffusion using spectral methods, and a robust numerical solver for non-trivial equilibrium systems.

• **Data Analysis & Pre-processing**: Cleaned historical observation data and quantified the key “sex ratio function” by conducting comparative analysis between **Polynomial Regression** and **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**, establishing the statistical foundation for the ecosystem model.

• **Core Simulation Engine**: Designed and implemented a solver based on the **Finite Difference Method** to handle the complex ODE-PDE coupling model. Introduced the **Dirac Delta function** to accurately mathematically express biological pulses within the ecosystem.

• **Optimization & Stability**: Implemented the **Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm** and **Trust Domain Policy Optimization (TRPO)** to solve for non-trivial equilibrium, ensuring numerical convergence where traditional black-box tools failed. Applied the **Chebyshev spectral method** to simulate the diffusion effect of parasites with high accuracy.
