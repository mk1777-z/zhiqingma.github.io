• Key platform features include: blockchain-based copyright evidence storage, smart contract-driven copyright transactions, multidimensional data analytics and visualization, regulatory auditing, and traceability queries.

• Blockchain: Developed smart contract chain codes based on **Hyperledger Fabric** to implement copyright evidence storage, automated transaction execution, and revenue distribution logic, ensuring tamper-proof and fully traceable transaction data.

• Data Storage: Designed a hybrid storage architecture storing critical transaction hashes on-chain while managing business data off-chain via **MySQL** and storing image/document files using **Huawei Cloud OBS**, balancing performance and security requirements.

• Backend: Designed and implemented the backend architecture for a blockchain-based smart copyright trading platform. Built high-performance RESTful APIs using **Golang + Hertz** microservices framework to support core functions including copyright registration on-chain, transaction execution, and regulatory review. Implemented a comprehensive permission control system encompassing user registration/login, JWT authentication, and regulatory review. Utilized WebSocket calls to large models for AI-assisted Q&A.
