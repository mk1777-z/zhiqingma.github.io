    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

Introduced the Dirac Delta function to accurately mathematically express biological pulses within the ecosystem.\n• Optimization & Stability: Implemented the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and Trust Domain Policy Optimization (TRPO) to solve for non-trivial equilibrium, ensuring numerical convergence where traditional black-box tools failed. Applied the Chebyshev spectral method to simulate the diffusion effect of parasites with high accuracy.\n\n(Click the image to view the technical paper)\nMCM/ICM (Mathematical Contest in Modeling) Meritorious Winner (First Prize) | Apr 2024"
